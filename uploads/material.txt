Phishing is a type of cyber attack where malicious actors trick individuals into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card numbers.
It often involves sending deceptive emails that appear to come from legitimate sources like banks, government agencies, or trusted companies.
These emails typically contain links to fake websites designed to harvest login credentials or personal data.
Spear phishing is a more targeted form of phishing, where attackers customize their messages based on specific individuals or organizations.
Unlike generic phishing, spear phishing may include personal details to make the message more convincing and increase the chances of success.
A common tactic in phishing is creating a sense of urgency, such as pretending a user’s account will be locked unless immediate action is taken.
Phishing campaigns are often the initial vector in major cyber attacks, including ransomware deployments and data breaches.
Phishing websites may use domain names that closely resemble legitimate ones, often with subtle character changes or subdomains.
Many phishing emails bypass spam filters by using compromised legitimate accounts or exploiting trusted services.
Attackers often use email spoofing to make their messages appear as though they are sent from official sources.
Business Email Compromise (BEC) is a high-risk phishing subtype where attackers impersonate executives to request wire transfers or sensitive data.
Credential harvesting is a common goal of phishing attacks, enabling attackers to access systems or sell credentials on dark web marketplaces.
Phishing simulations are used by organizations to test employees’ awareness and improve cybersecurity training.
Multifactor authentication (MFA) can mitigate phishing risk by requiring more than just a stolen password for access.
However, advanced phishing kits are now capable of bypassing MFA through real-time proxy attacks.
Users should always verify the sender’s email address and hover over links to inspect the URL before clicking.
Modern phishing campaigns also occur through SMS (smishing) and voice calls (vishing), not just email.
Anti-phishing tools, browser filters, and email gateways help detect and block many phishing attempts.
Regular user education and awareness are essential for defending against evolving phishing techniques.
Despite widespread knowledge of phishing, it remains one of the most successful attack vectors due to human error and trust exploitation.
