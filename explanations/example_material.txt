Cybersecurity threats are constantly evolving as attackers develop more sophisticated methods to breach systems and steal information . This document explores the most common and significant types of cybersecurity attacks, including how they work .

Phishing is a type of social engineering attack where attackers impersonate legitimate entities to trick users into revealing sensitive data . These attacks are often carried out through deceptive emails, messages, or fake websites . Variants include: Spear Phishing: Targeted at specific individuals . Whaling: Aimed at high-level executives .

In 2020, hackers used spear phishing emails to access Twitter’s internal tools, compromising several high-profile accounts . Smishing & Vishing: Conducted via SMS (smishing) or voice calls (vishing) 2. Malware is any software designed to cause damage or gain unauthorized access to a system .

Virus includes viruses, worms, trojans, spyware, ransomware, and adware . Common types: Attach to legitimate files and spread upon execution . Ransomware: Encrypts data and demands a ransom .

Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks intercept communications between two parties without their knowledge . Spyware: Collects information without user consent .

Public Wi-Fi networks are frequent targets due to lack of encryption . Common methods: Session Hijacking, HTTPS Spoofing, Wi-fi Eavesdropping and DDoS attacks .

The 2016 DDoS attack on DNS provider Dyn took down Twitter, Netflix, etc. 5.SQL injection involves inserting malicious code into input fields to manipulate backend databases . Targets include login forms and search fields .

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks inject malicious scripts into webpages viewed by users . LinkedIn’s 2012 breach involved SQL injection vulnerabilities .

Credential Stuffing involves using stolen credentials to access multiple accounts . Defense: Strong password policies and MFA . Example: Dunkin’ Donuts 2018 breach via credential stuffing .

These attacks exploit unknown vulnerabilities before a patch is available . Types: Malicious Insiders- Negligent Insiders. 9.0-0-zero-day Exploits.

Malware is downloaded without consent when visiting a compromised site . Defense: Keep software updated and use secure DNS . Use secure DNS to avoid drive-by downloads .

Tries every password combination until successful . Mitigation: Rate limiting, account lockouts . Social EngineeringManipulates people into giving up confidential data .

DNS Spoofs DNS records to redirect users . Solution: Use DNSSEC . Tactics: Pretexting, baiting, tailgating .

Malicious code that triggers based on a condition is often hidden in legitimate-looking files or scripts . Scammers impersonate executives or vendors for financial fraud .

Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) is leased to affiliates . Toyota lost $37 million to a BEC scam in 2019 .

Targets vulnerable elements in the supply chain . Example: SolarWinds 2020 breach compromised software updates . 17.5% of attacks target vulnerable elements of supply chain. 18% of the attacks target supply chain suppliers .

CryptojackingUses victim’s devices to mine cryptocurrency . Symptoms: Slow performance, overheating . Fileless Attacks run in memory rather than disk, harder to detect .

Compromise a trusted website to target a group . Common via PowerShell or WMI scripts . Watering Hole attacks are common via WMI or PowerShell scripts .

Cyber attacks are diverse and constantly evolving . Defending against them requires understanding, layered security, and continuous vigilance . Cyberattacks are diverse, constantly evolving and require understanding and layered security .
